## 📚 Project History

The idea for Kudos was born at LicorcaConf during a talk about Impostor Syndrome. Silvia shared that she had a physical folder where she kept the good things that happened to her at work. Inspired by this idea, a physical jar was created that was filled with notes about personal achievements.

The concept was shared on Twitter and gained popularity, being mentioned at events like AntiEvent, TechFest, and Software Crafters in Barcelona. This app is the digital version of that physical jar, allowing everyone to have their own space to celebrate their achievements.
